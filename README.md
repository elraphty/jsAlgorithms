  <tr>
    <td>Fizz Buzz</td>
    <td>
      Fizz buzz returns fizz when the number is divisible by    3,buzz when the number is divisible by 5 and fizz Buzz    when it is divisible by 15, its a common javascript       algorithm you can also achieve this functionality with    any given sets of number 3, 5 and 15 is not a             constant.

    <td>Is Palindrome</td>
    <td>
      isPalindrome is a function that returns true if a given 
      number of words is the same when reversed e.g madam i'm adam 
      when reversed it gives u the same word.

    <td>Binary Search</td>
    <td>
      Binary Search is a very popular algorithm is the most efficient algorithm for searching a given set of data, Binary search is a Logarithmic Runtime Big O Notation "0 (log n)", it can be implemented with a recursive function, or a while loop, this example i made use of a recursive function (you can check the bigONotation.js file for a binarySearch implemented with a while loop), so what binary search does is it searches for a key in a given set of data it starts from the middle of a sorted data if the key is the middle element in the dataset it returns else if they key is greater than the middle element is splices the array into two forget about the lower part of the array and search the upper part of the array and vise versa if the key is lesser than the middle element, it returns -1 if the key is not found.

    <td>
      Ceaser cipher is an algorithm that takes a given string and a number and shift each letter in the string by the given number passed.
